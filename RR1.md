From my perspective, people are made of both virtual bodies and biological bodies. Because we use both of these identities to socialize with people, communicate, observe and learn, and because of these actions, we become the person we are. The virtual body and biological body are also interrelated and associated. Even though they can be different versions of us with specific characteristics and personalities in a different context, both identities are the embodiment of a complete ourselves, because all the actions are manipulated by us. This is also why in the real world we can get traumatized after we were hurt or betrayed in the virtual world, and vice versa. What’s more, I think there are increasing intersection between the virtual body and the biological body nowadays. Because a lot of apps and websites are asking for the authentication of people’s real-world identities, such as phone numbers and id numbers, and this makes part of our virtual identity also the real-world identity. 
 
The reading mentioned a lot of violence, and betrayal in cyberspace. This reminded me of my own experience on the internet. I have seen cyberstalking, harassment, and violence on the internet. People use malicious and rude words to give comments, and send threatening and intimidating messages repeatedly. However, at the same time, it also made me think about the potential good side of high infidelity. “The virtual world makes race/gender not matter anymore”, so we can have a more equal and safe environment to talk behind the screen, and eventually have a more inclusive environment for everyone.
