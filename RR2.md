I feel nostalgic when I looked at the elements like the “under construction” signs, outer space backgrounds, MIDI files, and collections of animated web graphics. The glittering button and GIFs resonate with me the most because I saw these two when I was a kid all the time on the internet, and now I really cannot see these elements that often. Also, even if the vernacular web2 is a website published 10 years ago, a lot of hypertexts are not clickable anymore. These make me strongly feel the rapid change in visual ideas and aesthetic taste in cyberspace and surprised me by the impermanence of the website.

Also, a sad thing I perceive while reading the text is that the personal Vernacular Web has now turned into a web space dominated by corporate culture. The big corporation uses all kinds of means to convey and instill this idea into the mass, that they are professional, while the Vernacular Web is amateurs. Just as the example in the reading, Google’s customized home page creates more distance between the users and itself by telling people it is absurd and furtile to make simple and silly graphics on their websites, eventually, the company achieved the goal of “wraps itself around every website like a dust jacket”, but makes fewer people have the confidence to develop their own web pages. All of this is just because the company wants to gain more lucrative profit and surplus value from the internet, but this may cause the reduction of diversity in cyberspace. 

I hope in order to preserve all of these Vernacular Web, we shouldn’t take it as "a subject of mockery", instead we should try to make the best out of it. Just like the glittering GIFs and starry background of a website, they are not ugly and clumsy at all, but just need us to use them in the right spot to create that happy vibe.
