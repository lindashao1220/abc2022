According to The Context of the Digital: A brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, online intimacy exists because the internet has developed its own way of developing relationships, to be more specific, things like the high-resolution of the video call and the varying casualness of the wordings that express the tenor of the relationship. What‚Äôs more, online relationships can even make up for the offline flaw of people‚Äôs emotions. Just as the artwork Playground created by Ann Hirsch mentioned in the reading, the leading lady of the play found that ‚Äúthe offline world around her wasn‚Äôt providing sufficient opportunities for her emotional and intellectual development‚Äù, instead, she eventually found the intimacy she dreamed about online through talking with an elder man online. This makes me feel like online or offline is just a way people communicate, a platform for people to meet each other, but to develop intimacy between, what is most important is spiritual communication and people‚Äôs values. Even in our daily life, it is no longer surprising to hear people find their boyfriend or girlfriend on Tinder or ‚Äã‚ÄãBumble. The reality proves to us that tight connections can start with a short introduction and develop through constant check-in through chat online. 

The second reading made me think of how technology nowadays can make the emotion of a couple after separation still digitally intertwined with each other. Also, I really love the quote "love undocumented is love unadvertised and unexploited; it is love that will fade gently like a photograph, instead of creeping up, algorithmically like a Google image search result." I think some people post pics of hanging out with friends and the food they had just for the sake of ‚Äúposting‚Äù, and thinking before posting should be a wiser choice.


The behaviors and interactions online that replace equivalents in the "real world" I can think of is a function when people chat on Instagram. When both of the users stay in the chat, ‚Äúboth of you are in chat‚Äù will appear. In this way, people will have a sense of talking in sync, instead of asynchronous, thus having a sense of face-to-face interaction. People can always talk to multiple people and multi-task when they are on the computer, so personally, I will feel very respected when this line shows up in my chat since this means they are attentive talking with me, and not distractedüòÜ( since people can always multi-tasking online). Also, we can see if the other is typing, which can be very interesting since sometimes people type for a long time, but eventually, you just receive a very short text. This shows online feedback always gives us to have more time to respond and think, and we will not allow our instinct impulse to answer others' questions directly.
