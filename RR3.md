How is spatiality constituted in the artists' works that are discussed?

For the first reading, in terms of spatiality, Cao Fei’s work combines virtuality and reality together. This can also relate to the first reading we had in class, the virtual self is the reflection of our true selves to some extent. “The image people created for their avatar usually do not mirror their physical body but are accumulations of imagination and desires. . . . Because avatars carry information about personal desires and cultural experiences, avatars do not represent the dream of cyberspace as a space without stereotype of human and discrimination.” To be more specific, Cao Fei tried to use different mediums to test the boundary between the virtual and physical worlds. She compared RL and SL and concluded that our inner selves would be revealed when we are online. Also, something fun about the reading is that it mentioned the cyber art island fetched 100,000 USD from an unidentified collector. This art piece is packaged as a real-estate agency and people are willing to spend a tremendous amount of money on constructing the virtual society. I think part of the reason is that people somehow feel attached to the virtual world.

In the reading Now You're in my Computer: Performing in the Network's Theater of Visibility by Megan Driscoll, I think spatiality is “a theater of visibility where our activities, our ideas and ourselves play out as an ongoing performance”. In the project Life Sharing,  the two artists unreservedly gave a full account of their life to the audience to convey the idea that “Privacy Is Stupid”, so do we every day, and actually, the phenomenon of self-disclosure on the internet is prevailing more than ever before. We post and share our life on social media constantly to reveal our identities and selves to friends and strangers. Eventually, our computers become extended us.
